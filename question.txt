Create a e-commerce site that supports only Electronics, 
Clothing and Food items with below features.

1. Create an InventoryManager that holds information about 
    the current stocks of the products and load up

2. Receive orders for products (electronics, clothing, food) 
    and reduce the content from inventory

3. Ensure at a time, only one order can be received per 
    product. (Because, if we have only 1 quantity, 
    then we shouldn't allow to place orders > 1.)

4. Consider a user places an order, then first reduce the 
    stock from the inventory and notify the CartManager 
    to add the items into cart

5. Make sure each product has its own property and falls 
    under either of the three categories called 
    "Electronics", "Food" and "Clothing". All these 
    categories are the children of "Product" class.

6. Each Product should be loaded from file. You should not 
    use new operator instantiate the Product class. 
    For ex, if you have an Iphone product class, it should 
    be loaded from a file using its fully qualified name.
